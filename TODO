DONE
- simple page
- deploy to jitsu
- static files
- function to download standings (saved files don't persist redeployment)
- create jitsu mongodb
- shove xml into mongo
- cron job to grab standings every day
- dynamic port, so I don't have to change when doing development
- move out username and password to something that is not checked in
- commit to github
- get rid of static and use express
- provide view to show data from mongo /xml/YYYYMMDD
- redo standings endpoint to be more RESTful and provide xml or json

TODO
- still have a bug with download of stats, loading yesterday
- parse xml instead of passing in date, then schedule job to run more freq
  not sure 7am is correct
- use mocha and write some tests
- define json format
- create json object from standings
- maybe store json in mongo as well, calculate after each insert?
- add highline and display graphs
- update README
- put on travis-ci?
