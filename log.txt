    Move connection info out.
    
    gitignore the mongo.conf file.  Need to rebase -i and clean all the private info out of the repo, then I can push to github.

    Add time to log

    Update README
    
    Done for the day, learned more about MongoDB and made progress on a side project.  Hopefully this will be enough to grab stats until I can get back to it.  Nodejitsu is pretty cool, although I miss ssh access and git push for deployment.  Maybe I should try nodester again.

    Oops, update package
    
    This deployed ok to nodejitsu.  Thinking about adding some parsing to the xml and scheduling it more than once a day.

    Rework mongo stuff
    
    Also got 4 and 5 Apr into mongo.  Just dumping xml at this point, need to figure out what else to do with it.
    
    Created alias bsmongo to login to the nodejitsu database with my local mongo shell.  Also add a script in bin to dump the database for backup purposes.
    
    Now to add cron and call it a day.

    Add mongo write and read
    
    Going to try mongolian, so I want to commit this.  Found out you can connect to the nodejitsu database remotely with the shell.  Run
    
    mongo staff.mongohq.com:10055/nodejitsudb404160879018
    
    Then co
    
    db.auth(username, password)
    
    show collections show dailies.
    
    I should be able to dump this database locally at some point.

    Move downloader out to standings.js
    
    Was more difficult than it should have been.  Had a standing.js and standings.js and was loading the one I wasn't editing and wondering why it wasn't picking up my changes.  Doh.

    Seems to work on jitsu

    Rename Apr 4 standings to the day, not the date I downloaded
    
    Clearer I hope.

    Now a file server
    
    node-static seems to work just fine.  Added the standings.xml from yesterday.  Now I just need to write the function to download it everyday and then setup a cron job to execute it.

    First commit
    
    Some info in the README.  Need to get the daily standings file saved somewhere without having to do it by hand.  Might miss one and then I'd have to wait until next year to do this.
